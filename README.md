## Overview

is an ASP.NET MVC application designed to manage categories, products, and orders within a streamlined and efficient system. This project follows a Master-Detail approach, where categories serve as the master entities and are associated with multiple products. Orders can be created with selected products and include image uploads.

## Features

- **Category Management**: Add, view, edit, and delete categories.
- **Product Management**: Add, view, edit, and delete products associated with categories.
- **Order Management**: Create and manage orders with product selection and image uploads.
- **AJAX Operations**: Dynamically fetch categories and products without reloading the page.
- **Master-Detail Relationship**: Categories contain multiple products, and orders include selected products.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET MVC**: Provides the structure and architecture for the web application.
- **Entity Framework (Database First)**: Manages database access and maps database schema to .NET objects.
- **Razor View Engine**: Renders dynamic web pages and integrates C# code with HTML.
- **AJAX and jQuery**: Enables asynchronous data fetching and enhances user experience.
- **SQL Server**: The relational database used for storing categories, products, and orders.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later
- Visual Studio 2019 or later
- SQL Server (for the database)

### Installation

    ```

2. **Open the Project**

    Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.

3. **Setup the Database**

    Ensure the SQL Server database is set up and configured. Use Entity Framework Database First approach to generate the models.

4. **Restore NuGet Packages**

    NuGet packages will be restored automatically when you build the project. If needed, you can manually restore packages via the NuGet Package Manager.

5. **Build the Project**

    ```bash
    Build > Build Solution
    ```

## Usage

- **Categories**: Manage categories through the Category section. You can add, view, edit, and delete categories.
- **Products**: Manage products in the Product section. Products are linked to categories, allowing for structured management.
- **Orders**: Create and manage orders in the Order section. Orders can include products, and you can upload images related to each order.

## AJAX Endpoints

- `GET /Order/getProductCategories`: Returns a list of categories in JSON format.
- `GET /Order/getProducts?categoryId={id}`: Returns a list of products for the specified category ID in JSON format.
- `POST /Order/Save`: Saves an order and handles image uploads. Returns a JSON status response.

## Project Structure

- **Models**: Contains the entity classes generated by Entity Framework, such as `Category`, `Product`, and `OrderMaster`.
- **Controllers**: Handles the logic for CRUD operations and data retrieval (e.g., `CategoryController`, `ProductController`, `OrderController`).
- **Views**: Razor views that provide the UI for interacting with categories, products, and orders.
